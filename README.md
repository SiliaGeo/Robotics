Kinematics of Robotic Arms
Flat Arm with Three Rotating Joints

This project focuses on implementing the straight-line kinematics of a robotic arm with three rotational degrees of freedom. The arm lies in a plane, and all axes are parallel, creating a simplified yet versatile mechanism.
Overview:

    Objective: Implement straight-line kinematics for a planar robotic arm with three rotating joints.
    Configuration: All three rotational degrees of freedom are parallel, and movement occurs within the same plane.
    Joint Angles Range: Vary the angles of the three joints in the range [0, 2𝜋) to explore the arm's workspace.
    Joint Lengths: Consider the lengths of the joints: 𝑙1 = 0.3, 𝑙2 = 0.10, 𝑙3 = 0.05.

Non-Flat Arm with Three Rotary Joints

This section of the project deals with a robotic arm with three rotational degrees of freedom, where the axes have distinct orientations.
Overview:

    Objective: Implement straight-line kinematics for a planar robotic arm with three rotating joints.
    Configuration: Joint 1 axis is perpendicular to Joint 2 axis, while Joints 2 and 3 have parallel axes.
    Joint Angles Range: Vary the angles of the three joints in the range [0, 2𝜋) to visualize the 3D workspace.
    Joint Lengths: Consider the lengths of the joints: 𝑙1 = 0.3, 𝑙2 = 0.10, 𝑙3 = 0.05.
